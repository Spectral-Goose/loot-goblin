## Statement of Purpose ##

The purpose of this project is to create a resource for tabletop roleplaying games that players and game masters can use to streamline their
experience using Loot Goblin's inventory database and campaign system.

### Problem Statement ###

There should exist a program that allows game master and players of table-top RPGs to keep track of difficult rules. Ideally, every rule of a 
role-playing table-top game should be used. Unfortunately, some table-top RGPs contain rules that can be difficult and time consuming and can 
consume a large amount of paper. Specifically, in Dungeons and Dragons, such rules as carry capacity and encumbrance are difficult to keep up 
with. Removing the rule entirely is a common fix, but leaves the game feeling unrealistic at times. Additionally, items can be given in secret, 
but verbal communication ruins the secrecy. I propose a system that uses databases and networking to allow a game master to give items to players 
and to allow players to easily check how much weight they are carrying. Additionally, this program would be able to keep track of all player 
stats and would be a tool to ease the play of table-top RPGs in as many ways as possible. Table-tops have rules that can be confusing at times, 
so I will make a program utilizing databases to fix the problem.
