## Research and Background ##

### Meteor and Web App Development ###
For Loot Goblin, I researched web app development as well as Meteor itself. I used Meteor's tutorials to get a better grasp on both of these
concepts. Learning how to use Meteor and learning how to develop web apps went hand in hand for me. Learning Meteor consisted of learning how
to use the framework alongside learning a few new terminal commands. I learned a basis for how to develop web apps as I learned to use the Meteor
framewowrk.

### Mongo Clusters ###

I also researched mongo clusters and found how to use them in deploying web apps such as my own. With many resources vying to
have you subscribe to their paid versions, researching mongo was probably the most difficult portion of my research. I was not sure which sites to
trust and which were just glorified advertisements. However, I eventually found a free resource to fit my needs.
